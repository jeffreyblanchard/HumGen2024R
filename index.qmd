This is a rendering of hmtl files from the [course repository](https://github.com/jeffreyblanchard/HumGen2024R) for Human Genome Analysis taught at the University of Massachusetts Amherst by Prof. Jeffrey Blanchard.  If you are not using RStudio (Posit) Cloud here are [directions](HumGen_github.html) for creating a RStudio project space that will sync with and download files from the course repo.
